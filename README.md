# Color Palettes

A simple package for authoring and managing color palettes. Allowing you to quickly switch the theme of bound graphics.

## Components
### Color Collection
A collection of color palettes. Assign this to your bound graphics objects to allow them to switch between palettes in the collection. You can create a new color collection through the `Assets/Create/Color Collection` menu.

### Color Palette
A color palette defines the specific colors for each color in the collection. e.g.

`MainColor -> white`
`SecondaryColor -> blue`
`AccentColor -> red`

### Color Palette Binding
A color palette binding component is to be added to your graphics objects. This is where you can assign which color field to use.
